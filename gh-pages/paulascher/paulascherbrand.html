introduction
    Paula Scher is a graphic designer born in Washington DC in 1948. She is one of the most significant graphic designers of our time and is named the ‘Goddess of Graphic Design’ because of her ability to effortlessly engage the audience by just using type and how she presents it. If she is known for more than recognisable branding for companies such as Tiffany and co-, Citibank, Microsoft, the Public Theatre and so much more. She was hugely inspired by the designer Seymour Chwast in the 60s and 70s by his clever use of blending type and image which inspired many more artists. She ended up marrying him in 1973 and later again in 1989. She graduated from the Tyler School of Art in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and then moved to New York where she began her career in the world of design. (Mundell Design History, 2017) 

career 

Paula Scher has an exceptionally long and interesting career in design that began when she graduated from the Tyler School of Art in 1970 where she then went to work as an artist at Random House. (Mundell Design History). A year later she was hired by CBS records and after a year left to become Atlantic Records Art Director, however she returned to CBS Records and stayed for a further 8 years under the same title of Art Director. During this time, she created many albums covers for artists and was nominated for four Grammys because of her design style. She was nominated in 1977 for Ginseng Woman and Yardbirds Favourites album, in 1978 for Heads and in 1980 for the One-on-One album. (Grammy, 2021). In her 50+ years of graphic designing, this was just the beginning. She left CBS Records in 1982 and started a business with a fellow classmate from the Tyler School of Art and named their graphic design company Koppel & Scher. After 6 years in business together the company they parted ways due to the recession in the 90’s. Since that business venture, she joined the Pentagram Multidisciplinary Design Studio in 1991. 

Pentagram 

Paula Scher joined the Pentagram Studio in 1991 where she and 22 other designers with all distinctive design disciplines come together to collaborate on projects or work independently. It is the largest Private Design company in the world, established in 1972 by Alan fletcher, Colin Forbes, Kenneth Grange in London, and over the years have expanded their studios in America such as New York, San Francisco, and Austin Texas. The main reason for The Pentagram is to bring together artists who are experts in their own disciplines, come together and collaborate with each other to construct highly intricate designs. Before Paula joined Pentagram, she was seen by the studio as the “master conjurer of the instantly familiar,” (Pentagram, Paula Scher, 2021) which means they noticed she had the ability to manipulate her use of typography in a certain way that caught the attention of so many people as well as other artists. Still today she is still based in New York and is a Principal of Pentagram after 30 years of design. In the many designs that she has created whilst working with Pentagram, one of her most instantly recognisable pieces is her 1996 The Public Theatre poster for ‘Bring Da Noise Bring Da Funk’. Noise/Funk became extremely popular where it was used as a guide for how other Broadway shows were to be advertised as well as other clients wanting their branding in that style. Her branding for Noise/Funk made her even more recognisable and desired in the world of design. (P. Scher, Twenty-Five Years at The Public, 2020).
